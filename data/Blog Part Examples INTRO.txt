Is Pre-Surgery Knee Conditioning Necessary For Older Adults?
Yes, pre-surgery knee conditioning is necessary for older adults because it strengthens muscles and improves knee function before the surgery. By practicing exercises like straight leg raises, heel slides, and quadriceps sets, you prepare the knee joint for surgery. This preparation also improves joint mobility and helps you recover smoothly after total knee arthroplasty or knee replacement surgery.
At COMPANY_NAME, our specialists guide older adults through safe pre-surgery programs. To promote recovery, we focus on thigh muscle strength, knee extension, and hip and knee flexion. With exercises like ankle pumps, sitting knee flexion, and short arc quadriceps, we prepare your affected knee for surgery. Call us at CALL_NUMBER to start knee conditioning that will significantly improve your recovery time.

How Long After an ACL Tear Can You Ski Again?
You can return to recreational skiing in four to six months and competitive skiing in six to nine months after a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). This recovery timeline depends on the severity of your ACL tear and knee joint damage. For example, if you have a partial tear, you may start ACL rehabilitation and gentle balance exercises within 4 weeks. In contrast, if you have a Grade 3 tear (complete tear), recovery can extend to months or even a year.
At COMPANY_NAME, our orthopedic surgeons help you through the entire process of your ACL recovery. We treat patients with ACL reconstruction surgery, tendon graft healing, and quadriceps and hamstrings strengthening. Our surgeons also provide medications, ice therapy, and an ACL brace for skiing to protect your knee. Moreover, our online patient portal makes managing appointments, records, and instructions convenient. Call us today at CALL_NUMBER for an immediate ACL tear treatment.

Can I Ski With a Suspected ACL or MCL Sprain?
No, you should not ski with a suspected ACL or MCL sprain. Skiing puts extreme stress on the knee joint and can turn a mild sprain into a severe tear. Skiing movements like twisting or landing increase the risk of ACL/MCL sprains or even other knee ligament injuries. Other than that, ignoring the injury and continuing to ski can lead to long-term instability and a longer recovery.
At COMPANY_NAME, our sports medicine specialists carefully examine your ski-related knee injury. Our team will perform a physical exam, magnetic resonance imaging, and X-rays for an accurate diagnosis. Then, we will design a treatment plan with non-surgical treatment, knee braces, or knee surgery if necessary. Call CALL_NUMBER for ACL/MCL sprain treatment.

Is Pain Under The Kneecap In Basketball Patellar Tendinopathy?
Yes, if you experience sharp pain under the kneecap while playing basketball, it signals patellar tendinopathy, also called jumper’s knee. This overuse injury causes tiny tears and degeneration in the patellar tendon (which connects the patella to the shin bone). In this condition, you may feel the pain below the kneecap, which can worsen with jumping, running, and other activities that put stress on the knee.
At COMPANY_NAME, our sports medicine specialists accurately diagnose your patellar tendonitis symptoms with imaging tests. Then, we will create a treatment plan that fits your needs. This may include rest and ice, a knee brace, platelet-rich plasma therapy, corticosteroid injections, or strengthening exercises. Call us at CALL_NUMBER today to explore your treatment options.

How To Tell If My Basketball Knee Injury Is Serious?
If you experience intense pain, immediate swelling, difficulty putting weight on your leg, or a locked knee after playing basketball, your injury could be serious. You might also hear a popping sound or struggle to fully extend your injured knee. These symptoms often indicate severe knee injuries, such as ACL/PCL injuries, meniscus tears, a dislocated kneecap, or complete ligament tears.
At COMPANY_NAME, our board-certified orthopedic surgeons assess your basketball-related knee injuries using advanced imaging tests. We check for ligament injury, patellar tendon damage, or meniscal tears. Then, we create a treatment plan with medications and targeted injections to reduce pain, control inflammation, and support your recovery. Call CALL_NUMBER for immediate basketball knee injury treatment.

Are Custom Orthotics Worth It For Lateral Knee Pain?
Yes, using custom orthotics is an effective way to manage your lateral knee pain because they improve foot alignment and reduce stress on your knee joint. This added stability helps if you have knee osteoarthritis, flat feet, or chronic discomfort while walking. Orthotics also ease foot pain, heel pain, and plantar fasciitis symptoms. By supporting your gait and balance, they provide long-term relief and lower your chances of future injury.
At COMPANY_NAME, our knee specialists recommend a full gait analysis to address your pain. We design custom-made orthotics and orthotic devices that provide cushioning, reduce pressure on sore spots in the feet, and improve balance. Our treatment also helps older adults, athletes, and patients with osteoarthritis. Call us today at CALL_NUMBER to start your treatment and get lasting relief.

When Should You Get a Second Opinion on Knee Surgery?
You should get a second opinion on knee surgery if you’re still experiencing knee pain, swelling, or stiffness despite following your first doctor’s treatment plan. You should also seek a second opinion if you’re unsure about the diagnosis or feel uneasy about the knee surgery. In these cases, getting a second opinion helps confirm the proper diagnosis and ensures the surgery is actually necessary.
At COMPANY_NAME, our orthopedic specialists bring years of experience in joint replacement and knee surgery. We begin by carefully reviewing your imaging and symptoms to understand the severity of your condition. Based on this review, our orthopedic surgeons may recommend NSAIDs, bracing, PRP therapy, and stem cell injections. Call us at CALL_NUMBER to schedule your second opinion visit and explore the safest options for your knee.

Does a PCL Injury Require Surgery?
No, a PCL injury does not always require surgery. Most low-grade posterior cruciate ligament injuries heal with non-surgical treatment like rest, crutches, and a knee brace. However, if you have a completely torn PCL that affects other ligaments like the ACL or MCL, orthopedic surgeons may recommend surgical repair using a PCL graft.
At COMPANY_NAME, our board-certified knee specialists treat all types of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries. To start, we use imaging tests like MRIs and CT scans to check the damage inside your knee joint. After that, we create a treatment plan that may include NSAIDs, a knee brace, or surgical PCL reconstruction. Call us at CALL_NUMBER to relieve knee pain and start your recovery.

How to Know if You Tore Your ACL?
If you feel or hear a popping sound in your knee during sudden movement, followed by sharp pain, rapid swelling, and knee instability, you may have an ACL tear. You may also notice reduced range of motion and trouble putting weight on your leg. Other than that, the injured knee may feel unstable or buckle during walking, stair climbing, or simple physical activity. Besides that, significant inflammation and bruising may also appear within hours after an ACL injury.
At COMPANY_NAME, we accurately diagnose ACL injuries using advanced imaging and physical exams. Our sports medicine physicians treat partial tears, complete tears, and other knee ligament injuries with proven techniques. Moreover, we offer non-surgical treatment, surgical intervention, and ACL reconstruction according to your injury and activity level.

However, if your procedure also involved meniscus repair or ACL reconstruction, recovery may take longer than four to six weeks.
At COMPANY_NAME, our board-certified surgeons help you manage pain and discomfort after arthroscopic knee surgery. We use proven recovery methods to reduce inflammation, support tissue healing, and restore movement in the knee joint.
